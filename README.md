# Overview & Credits

A simple tool that lets you set a specific mod to monitor, it will detect any changes each time you launch your game and re-PAK for you.

Requires the full installer verison of KCD2-PAK by 7H3LaughingMan - [GitHub](https://github.com/7H3LaughingMan/KCD2-PAK)

# Usage

Download the latest exe from releases, drop it wherever you like

Double click it to run.

Browse to set the path to the mod you wish to monitor - Note: It must contain a valid .manifest file or it wont work.

Optonal - Click Save to remember this mod path each time you open the exe

Launch KCD2 as normal - It will always skip the PAK process on first load, so make sure you've got your initial manual PAK there.

As long as the exe is still running in the background it will detect the next time you run the game, checks if your mod files have changed, then it will re-PAK and launch the game for you.

Note: If you don't want the programme in the way, you can minimise it to tray.
